//Instructions For each solution you will need the following:
//Label the section of code appropriately with comments
//Write the givens as appropriately named variables or constants.
//Declare a variable for your result.
//Use the variables to calculate the result (NOT the literal values or numbers)
//Calculate the result using the variables in an expression
//Assign the calculation to the resulting variable.
//Make sure to print the result in the console (Remember to include units like “feet” and “slices of pizza”)
//Comment every line of code (describe what each line is doing in English)
//Don't forget!
//Test your code! Do the calculations on your own calculator. Check that the computer is producing the same result.
//    Commit often!
//A "given" is a variable that is part of the initial set up of a formula. You should write your code so anyone can change the values of the givens and the result of the calculation should still be accurate.
