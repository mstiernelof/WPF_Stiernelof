 *  Created by marie stiernelof 11/13/13 Assignment: Conditionals
 */
//create code that calculates a result
//submits 5
//what will code calculate
//2 givens that should be prompted
//At least two factors must be essential for the calculation.
// If one of the factors (the pieces of information you are collecting with the prompts)
// is not needed in order to calculate the result then it is not essential.
//declare variable for the result
//Calculate the result using the variables in an expression (NOT the literal values or numbers)
//Result should appear in the browser's console. With an explanation, include units of measurement

//!! Must use conditionals to validate the information
//Ex. if the user does not enter a value for the first prompt, make a conditional that checks if
// the value is empty. You can do this by evaluating if the contents of the prompt are the same
// as an empty string (which looks like "" i.e. thats two quotations with no character between them)
//comment on every line explaining what is being done

//Each of the following must be used in in at least one of the 3 projects
//1.ternary 2.else if 3.logical operator 4.relational operator other than ==
//20 commits for each project!

//0 commits
//Do you want to make  peppermint hot cocoa mix? It makes an excellent christmas gift. How many jars would you like to make?
